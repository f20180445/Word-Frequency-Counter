# Word-Frequency-Counter

1) commonWords.py is a small external script to get the top 100 common English words from wikipedia, it creates the file with commmon words.

2) form app is created that has the views.py (to go to the URL and get the words and their frequency) and models.py (database to store the word and its count)

3) form directory also has templates directory that store the html files for host:frequency and host:result pages

4) EDIT - the app is no longer available. the app is hosted on https://atgtask2jainam.herokuapp.com/frequency/
